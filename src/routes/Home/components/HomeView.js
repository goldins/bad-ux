    <br />
    <p>Notes to self: ES6 (clean - for now); one-directional data flow (global store and events?);
      ugly starter app (but it will do - the focus here is React); clean & clear routes;
      to be continued.

    <p>Note to others: Don't actually use any of these UX patterns in real life.</p>
