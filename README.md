Cloned from https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit (same deployment steps).

The purpose of this repository is to showcase some bad user experience patterns - either reproduced from samples found on the web, or so outlandish that they have been created as a cruel joke for this project.

The "true" purpose of this project is to get more familiar with React, redux, and related libraries, frameworks, patterns, etc.

Screenshots and/or descriptions of implemented components below.
